On respective commits:
```
latexpand main.tex > {old,new}.tex
```
Or maybe call the above with --empty-comments, not sure why.

Then comment out authors, CCS, keywords, and acks, and
```
$ latexdiff --exclude-textcmd=section,subsection,cmidrule,cmidrulewidth --exclude-safecmd=cmidrule,cmidrulewidth --disable-auto-mbox --graphics-markup=1 old.tex new.tex > diff.tex
```

and fix the remaining compilation errors.
