(* Some helpful tactics. *)

(* Adds an equality in the context *)
Ltac ctx e1 e2 :=
  let H := fresh "HCtx" in
  assert (e1 = e2) as H by reflexivity.

(* Standard inversion/subst/clear abbrev. *)
Tactic Notation "inv" hyp(H) := inversion H; subst; clear H.
Tactic Notation "inv" hyp(H) "as" simple_intropattern(p) :=
  inversion H as p; subst; clear H.
