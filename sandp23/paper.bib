abstract = {SMT-based checking of refinement types for call-by-value languages is a well-studied
subject. Unfortunately, the classical translation of refinement types to verification
conditions is unsound under lazy evaluation. When checking an expression, such systems
implicitly assume that all the free variables in the expression are bound to values.
This property is trivially guaranteed by eager, but does not hold under lazy, evaluation.
Thus, to be sound and precise, a refinement type system for Haskell and the corresponding
verification conditions must take into account which subset of binders actually reduces
to values. We present a stratified type system that labels binders as potentially
diverging or not, and that (circularly) uses refinement types to verify the labeling.
We have implemented our system in LIQUIDHASKELL and present an experimental evaluation
of our approach on more than 10,000 lines of widely used Haskell libraries. We show
that LIQUIDHASKELL is able to prove 96% of all recursive functions terminating, while
requiring a modest 1.7 lines of termination-annotations per 100 lines of code.},

abstract = {This article describes CCured, a program transformation system that adds type safety
guarantees to existing C programs. CCured attempts to verify statically that memory
errors cannot occur, and it inserts run-time checks where static verification is insufficient.CCured
extends C's type system by separating pointer types according to their usage, and
it uses a surprisingly simple type inference algorithm that is able to infer the appropriate
pointer kinds for existing C programs. CCured uses physical subtyping to recognize
and verify a large number of type casts at compile time. Additional type casts are
verified using run-time type information. CCured uses two instrumentation schemes,
one that is optimized for performance and one in which metadata is stored in a separate
data structure whose shape mirrors that of the original user data. This latter scheme
allows instrumented programs to invoke external functions directly on the program's
data without the use of a wrapper function.We have used CCured on real-world security-critical
network daemons to produce instrumented versions without memory-safety vulnerabilities,
and we have found several bugs in these programs. The instrumented code is efficient
enough to be used in day-to-day operations.},

pages="76--98",
abstract="Checked C is a new effort working toward a memory-safe C. Its design is distinguished from that of prior efforts by truly being an extension of C: Every C program is also a Checked C program. Thus, one may make incremental safety improvements to existing codebases while retaining backward compatibility. This paper makes two contributions. First, to help developers convert existing C code to use so-called checked (i.e., safe) pointers, we have developed a preliminary, automated porting tool. Notably, this tool takes advantage of the flexibility of Checked C's design: The tool need not perfectly classify every pointer, as required of prior all-or-nothing efforts. Rather, it can make a best effort to convert more pointers accurately, without letting inaccuracies inhibit compilation. However, such partial conversion raises the question: If safety violations can still occur, what sort of advantage does using Checked C provide? We draw inspiration from research on migratory typing to make our second contribution: We prove a blame property that renders so-called checked regions blameless of any run-time failure. We formalize this property for a core calculus and mechanize the proof in Coq.",

abstract = { C remains central to our computing infrastructure. It is notionally defined by ISO
standards, but in reality the properties of C assumed by systems code and those implemented
by compilers have diverged, both from the ISO standards and from each other, and none
of these are clearly understood. We make two contributions to help improve this error-prone
situation. First, we describe an in-depth analysis of the design space for the semantics
of pointers and memory in C as it is used in practice. We articulate many specific
questions, build a suite of semantic test cases, gather experimental data from multiple
implementations, and survey what C experts believe about the de facto standards. We
identify questions where there is a consensus (either following ISO or differing)
and where there are conflicts. We apply all this to an experimental C implemented
above capability hardware. Second, we describe a formal model, Cerberus, for large
parts of C. Cerberus is parameterised on its memory model; it is linkable either with
a candidate de facto memory object model, under construction, or with an operational
C11 concurrency model; it is defined by elaboration to a much simpler Core language
for accessibility, and it is executable as a test oracle on small examples. This should
provide a solid basis for discussion of what mainstream C is now: what programmers
and analysis tools can assume and what compilers aim to implement. Ultimately we hope
it will be a step towards clear, consistent, and accepted semantics for the various
use-cases of C. },

abstract = {The serious bugs and security vulnerabilities facilitated by C/C++'s lack of bounds
checking are well known, yet C and C++ remain in widespread use. Unfortunately, C's
arbitrary pointer arithmetic, conflation of pointers and arrays, and programmer-visible
memory layout make retrofitting C/C++ with spatial safety guarantees extremely challenging.
Existing approaches suffer from incompleteness, have high runtime overhead, or require
non-trivial changes to the C source code. Thus far, these deficiencies have prevented
widespread adoption of such techniques.This paper proposes SoftBound, a compile-time
transformation for enforcing spatial safety of C. Inspired by HardBound, a previously
proposed hardware-assisted approach, SoftBound similarly records base and bound information
for every pointer as disjoint metadata. This decoupling enables SoftBound to provide
spatial safety without requiring changes to C source code. Unlike HardBound, SoftBound
is a software-only approach and performs metadata manipulation only when loading or
storing pointer values. A formal proof shows that this is sufficient to provide spatial
safety even in the presence of arbitrary casts. SoftBound's full checking mode provides
complete spatial violation detection with 67% runtime overhead on average. To further
reduce overheads, SoftBound has a store-only checking mode that successfully detects
all the security vulnerabilities in a test suite at the cost of only 22% runtime overhead
on average.},

abstract = {Temporal memory safety errors, such as dangling pointer dereferences and double frees,
are a prevalent source of software bugs in unmanaged languages such as C. Existing
schemes that attempt to retrofit temporal safety for such languages have high runtime
overheads and/or are incomplete, thereby limiting their effectiveness as debugging
aids. This paper presents CETS, a compile-time transformation for detecting all violations
of temporal safety in C programs. Inspired by existing approaches, CETS maintains
a unique identifier with each object, associates this metadata with the pointers in
a disjoint metadata space to retain memory layout compatibility, and checks that the
object is still allocated on pointer dereferences. A formal proof shows that this
is sufficient to provide temporal safety even in the presence of arbitrary casts if
the program contains no spatial safety violations. Our CETS prototype employs both
temporal check removal optimizations and traditional compiler optimizations to achieve
a runtime overhead of just 48% on average. When combined with a spatial-checking system,
the average overall overhead is 116% for complete memory safety},

abstract = { We present a ``negative'' semantics of the C11 language---a semantics that does not
just give meaning to correct programs, but also rejects undefined programs. We investigate
undefined behavior in C and discuss the techniques and special considerations needed
for formally specifying it. We have used these techniques to modify and extend a semantics
of C into one that captures undefined behavior. The amount of semantic infrastructure
and effort required to achieve this was unexpectedly high, in the end nearly doubling
the size of the original semantics. From our semantics, we have automatically extracted
an undefinedness checker, which we evaluate against other popular analysis tools,
using our own test suite in addition to a third-party test suite. Our checker is capable
of detecting examples of all 77 categories of core language undefinedness appearing
in the C11 standard, more than any other tool we considered. Based on this evaluation,
we argue that our work is the most comprehensive and complete semantic treatment of
undefined behavior in C, and thus of the C language itself. },
