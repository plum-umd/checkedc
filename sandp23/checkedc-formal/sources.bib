abstract = {The serious bugs and security vulnerabilities facilitated by C/C++'s lack of bounds
checking are well known, yet C and C++ remain in widespread use. Unfortunately, C's
arbitrary pointer arithmetic, conflation of pointers and arrays, and programmer-visible
memory layout make retrofitting C/C++ with spatial safety guarantees extremely challenging.
Existing approaches suffer from incompleteness, have high runtime overhead, or require
non-trivial changes to the C source code. Thus far, these deficiencies have prevented
widespread adoption of such techniques.This paper proposes SoftBound, a compile-time
transformation for enforcing spatial safety of C. Inspired by HardBound, a previously
proposed hardware-assisted approach, SoftBound similarly records base and bound information
for every pointer as disjoint metadata. This decoupling enables SoftBound to provide
spatial safety without requiring changes to C source code. Unlike HardBound, SoftBound
is a software-only approach and performs metadata manipulation only when loading or
storing pointer values. A formal proof shows that this is sufficient to provide spatial
safety even in the presence of arbitrary casts. SoftBound's full checking mode provides
complete spatial violation detection with 67% runtime overhead on average. To further
reduce overheads, SoftBound has a store-only checking mode that successfully detects
all the security vulnerabilities in a test suite at the cost of only 22% runtime overhead
on average.},

title = {{Semantics Engineering with PLT Redex}},
year = {2009},
isbn = {0262062755},
publisher = {The MIT Press},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {This text is the first comprehensive presentation of reduction semantics in one volume;
it also introduces the first reliable and easy-to-use tool set for such forms of semantics.
Software engineers have long known that automatic tool support is critical for rapid
prototyping and modeling, and this book is addressed to the working semantics engineer
(graduate student or professional language designer). The book comes with a prototyping
tool suite to develop, explore, test, debug, and publish semantic models of programming
languages. With PLT Redex, semanticists can formulate models as grammars and reduction
models on their computers with the ease of paper and pencil. The text first presents
a framework for the formulation of language models, focusing on equational calculi
and abstract machines, then introduces PLT Redex, a suite of software tools for expressing
these models as PLT Redex models. Finally, experts describe a range of models formulated
in Redex. PLT Redex comes with the PLT Scheme implementation, available free at http://www.plt-scheme.org/.
Readers can download the software and experiment with Redex as they work their way
through the book. For more information (including the preface, a sample syllabus,
and a quick introduction to Redex), see the Redex website at http://redex.plt-scheme.org/.
Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, and Matthew Flatt are the authors (with
Shiram Krishnamurthi) of How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and
Computing, also published by the MIT Press.}

abstract="This article presents the formal semantics of a large subset of the C language called Clight. Clight includes pointer arithmetic, struct and union types, C loops and structured switch statements. Clight is the source language of the CompCert verified compiler. The formal semantics of Clight is a big-step operational semantics that observes both terminating and diverging executions and produces traces of input/output events. The formal semantics of Clight is mechanized using the Coq proof assistant. In addition to the semantics of Clight, this article describes its integration in the CompCert verified compiler and several ways by which the semantics was validated.",

abstract = { C remains central to our computing infrastructure. It is notionally defined by ISO
standards, but in reality the properties of C assumed by systems code and those implemented
by compilers have diverged, both from the ISO standards and from each other, and none
of these are clearly understood. We make two contributions to help improve this error-prone
situation. First, we describe an in-depth analysis of the design space for the semantics
of pointers and memory in C as it is used in practice. We articulate many specific
questions, build a suite of semantic test cases, gather experimental data from multiple
implementations, and survey what C experts believe about the de facto standards. We
identify questions where there is a consensus (either following ISO or differing)
and where there are conflicts. We apply all this to an experimental C implemented
above capability hardware. Second, we describe a formal model, Cerberus, for large
parts of C. Cerberus is parameterised on its memory model; it is linkable either with
a candidate de facto memory object model, under construction, or with an operational
C11 concurrency model; it is defined by elaboration to a much simpler Core language
for accessibility, and it is executable as a test oracle on small examples. This should
provide a solid basis for discussion of what mainstream C is now: what programmers
and analysis tools can assume and what compilers aim to implement. Ultimately we hope
it will be a step towards clear, consistent, and accepted semantics for the various
use-cases of C. },
